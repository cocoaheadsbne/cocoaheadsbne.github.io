This month, Ben will demo how to use Sketch for native design and development, while Luzian will share his experiences of building a cross-platform app using PhoneGap and Sencha Touch.

Thanks to Bohemian Coding, we'll also have a free copy of Sketch to give away. We're still looking for sponsors to help cater the event, so email ben at thoughtfulpixel dot com if you know anyone who might be interested.

For those of you who haven't been to River City Labs. Take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) 
As usual, thanks to Peta, Keera and the team at Rivier City Labs for helping with the venue!
