We've two presentations on iOS development for our first meetup of 2014: Matt will do a short overview of how to use Javascript in your app, and Ben will demo how to implement custom View Controller transitions on iOS 7.

With free food and drinks provided thanks to Microsoft's Azure Mobile Services, it's a great chance to meet (or catch up with) others in your local Apple development community. To one lucky attendee, we'll also give away a copy of Reveal (thanks to Itty Bitty Apps). Look forward to seeing you there!

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) and we'll come get you.
