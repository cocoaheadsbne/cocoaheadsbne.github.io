This month Lachlan is presenting a talk about Xamarin, a cross platform development environment.

Matt is also going to do a little talk on logging application crashes / exceptions with Errbit.

We're still looking for sponsors to cater the event, so please contact Ben if you know anyone who might be keen.

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) and we'll come get you.
