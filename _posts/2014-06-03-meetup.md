This month Gabriel is doing a talk on "Multi-peer Connectivity" and Peter is doing a talk on "Extending your native app with JavaScriptCore and Objective-C/JavaScript bridging".

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) and we'll come get you.
