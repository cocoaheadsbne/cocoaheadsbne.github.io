This month Gabriel is presenting a talk on Multi-peer Connectivity.

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) and we'll come get you.

Our friends at UBER have offered to get you to or from River City Labs for your CocoaHeads Brisbane Meetup! UBER are giving you a free ride up to $30 valid for this event only. If you don't know already UBER is a technology company that connects riders with drivers through a smartphone app and is about 30% cheaper than a regular taxi!
