This month is all about creating realtime and event-driven apps using functional programming on iOS. 

Rob will talk about how he built his latest app using a library from GitHub called ReactiveCocoa. Roger will give us an overview of a realtime data layer called Firebase and Ben will show how Firebase & ReactiveCocoa can be used together to great realtime apps.

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) and I'll come get you.
