This month, Peter Smith will talk about his experiences making money as an Indie iOS Developer while Ian Connor from Encore will give us a demo of their iBeacon app.

Thanks to Encore & River City Labs for sponsoring this meetup.

Encore (encore.io) is a mobile app platform. Their cloud-based mobile backend enables companies to create apps faster & cheaper. Simply put – it takes less time to deploy a mobile app if most of the mobile backend already exists.

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) and we'll come get you.
