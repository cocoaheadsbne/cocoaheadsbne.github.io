This month Lachlan Hardy from Microsoft will give us an overview of Windows Azure Mobile Services incl. how to create an iOS app using Azure as a cloud-based backend. If there's time, Ben will also do a presentation on using iOS 7's new view controller transitioning APIs.

For those of you who haven't been to River City Labs. Take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141)
