This month Rob is presenting about Everyday ReactiveCocoa and Lachlan will give us an overview of UIResponder.

We're still looking for sponsors to cater the event, so please contact Ben if you know anyone who might be keen.

When you get to River City Labs, take the lift to the second floor. If no one is waiting at the door, call Ben (0434 909 033) or Matt (0419 743 141) and we'll come get you.
